# nanoget
This module provides functions to extract useful metrics from Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads and alignments.  

## FUNCTIONS
Data can be presented in the following formats, using the following functions:  
- A sorted bam file `processBam(bamfile, threads)`  
- A standard fastq file `processFastqPlain(fastqfile)`  
- A fastq file with metadata from MinKNOW or Albacore `processFastq_rich(fastqfile)`  
- A sequencing_summary file generated by Albacore `processSummary(sequencing_summary.txt)`  

Fastq files can be compressed using gzip, bzip2 or bgzip. The data is returned as a pandas DataFrame with standardized headernames for convenient extraction. The functions perform logging while being called and extracting data.
